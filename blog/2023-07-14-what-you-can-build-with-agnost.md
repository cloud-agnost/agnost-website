## The Applications You Can Build With Agnost

With Agnost at your fingertips, the kind of applications you can build are only
limited by your imagination. Let's explore some categories of applications that
you can create with Agnost:

### Web Applications

Web applications are the backbone of the internet, from simple blogs to complex
enterprise solutions. With Agnost, creating these applications is as simple as
pie. You can leverage its built-in components like the application server and
database to quickly set up and scale your web applications.

Consider creating a blog site. Instead of juggling multiple technologies and
orchestrating them to work together, with Agnost, you can focus on the logic of
your application while the heavy lifting is taken care of. Here's a simple
example of how to create an endpoint for a blog post:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a new blog post endpoint
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const agnost = require("agnost")

app.post("/blog", async (req, res) => {
  const blogPost = req.body

  // Save the blog post using Agnost's integrated database component
  const result = await agnost.db.save("BlogPosts", blogPost)

  res.status(201).send(result)
})

Agnost.listen(app)
```

### CRM Applications

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications are vital for businesses to
manage and analyze customer interactions and data. Agnost, with its powerful
database and realtime capabilities, can handle the high data loads and
instantaneous updates that CRM applications demand.

Imagine developing a feature that allows sales representatives to instantly see
updates about their leads. The Agnost-powered code snippet would look something
like this:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a real-time lead update feature
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const agnost = require("agnost")

// Listen for updates in the 'Leads' collection
agnost.db.collection("leads").onChange((change) => {
  // Notify the sales representatives about the lead update in real-time
  agnost.realtime.broadcast("leadUpdate", change)
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

### Social Networking Applications

Social networking applications require handling multiple users, real-time
updates, and secure authentication. Agnost, with its integrated authentication,

the park.

Take the example of creating a new user in a social network. The code snippet
using Agnost would look like this:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a new user in a social networking application
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const agnost = require("agnost")

app.post("/users", async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body

  // Create a new user using Agnost's integrated authentication system
  const result = await agnost.auth.createUser(user)

  res.status(201).send(result)
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

### Chat Applications

Building chat applications involves handling real-time communication between
multiple users. Agnost's real-time capabilities come to the fore here, making it
easy to build dynamic, responsive chat applications.

For instance, let's consider the creation of a chat message endpoint. Using
Agnost, the implementation might look like this:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a new chat message endpoint
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const agnost = require("agnost")

app.post("/message", async (req, res) => {
  const message = req.body

  // Save the message using Agnost's integrated database component
  const result = await agnost.db.save("messages", message)

  // Broadcast the message in real-time
  agnost.realtime.broadcast("newMessage", result)

  res.status(201).send(result)
})

Agnost.listen(app)
```

### Collaborative Tools

Real-time collaboration tools require handling simultaneous updates from
multiple users and reflecting these updates in real time. Agnost's real-time and
database capabilities make it easy to build these kinds of applications.

For example, let's build a real-time document editing feature. The code snippet
using Agnost could look something like this:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a real-time document editing feature
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const agnost = require("agnost")

// Listen for updates in the 'Documents' collection
agnost.db.collection("documents").onChange((change) => {
  // Broadcast the document update in real-time
  agnost.realtime.broadcast("documentUpdate", change)
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

### AI-Powered Applications

AI-powered applications require processing large amounts of data, and Agnost's
powerful database and queue capabilities make it a good fit for these
applications. Whether it's for running complex machine learning algorithms or
handling big data, Agnost is up to the task.

For instance, consider a scenario where you need to run a time-consuming AI
task. Using Agnost's queue capabilities, this task can be processed in the
background:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to process an AI task in the background
const Agnost = require("agnost")

// Define an AI task
const aiTask = async (data) => {
  // Run your AI algorithm here
}

// Add the AI task to Agnost's queue for background processing
agnost.queue.add(aiTask, { data: "your-data" })
```

### E-commerce Applications

E-commerce applications are complex, requiring features like shopping carts,
payment processing, and inventory management. With Agnost's robust database and
powerful application server, building these applications becomes
straightforward.

Here's how you can create a shopping cart feature using Agnost:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a shopping cart in an e-commerce application
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const Agnost = require("agnost")

app.post("/cart", async (req, res) => {
  const cart = req.body

  // Save the shopping cart using Agnost's integrated database component
  const result = await agnost.db.save("carts", cart)

  res.status(201).send(result)
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

## The Endless Possibilities

> with Custom Node.js Express Routes and Middlewares

Beyond these core capabilities, Agnost's flexibility is further enhanced by the
support for custom Node.js Express routes and middlewares. This capability
allows developers to tailor and extend Agnost to suit their unique needs.

### The Power of Custom Routes

Custom routes allow you to define your own endpoints and handle HTTP requests in
a way that fits your application's requirements. This is similar to how a city's
road network can be customized to best serve its inhabitants.

Take the example of creating a custom route to handle a unique requirement in
your application:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a custom route
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const Agnost = require("agnost")

app.get("/custom", async (req, res) => {
  // Handle the GET request in a custom way
  const result = await customFunction(req.query)

  res.status(200).send(result)
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

Just like how a city planner has the flexibility to design a road network, as a
developer, you have the flexibility to design your application's endpoint
structure with custom routes.

### The Power of Custom Middlewares

In Express, a middleware is a function that has access to the request object,
the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response
cycle. Middlewares can execute any code, transform the request and the response
objects, or end the request-response cycle. If the current middleware function
does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control
to the next middleware function.

Agnost embraces this philosophy and allows developers to use custom middlewares,
enabling you to add custom logic to your application's request-response cycle.

Consider a custom middleware that logs the time of every request to your
application:

```javascript
// Using Agnost to create a custom middleware
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
const Agnost = require("agnost")

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request received at ${new Date().toISOString()}`)
  next()
})

agnost.listen(app)
```

## Final Thoughts

This custom middleware logs the time of the request before passing control to
the next middleware in the chain. This is similar to how a security guard checks
everyone entering a building and then passes them on to their destination.

Having explored the vast landscape of possibilities that Agnost offers, let's
circle back to the essence of Agnost. It is an open-source Kubernetes
development platform, encompassing the building blocks required for software
development, wrapped in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Much like how a painter uses a palette of colors to create art, as a developer,
you use Agnost to craft applications. From the application server to the
database, from authentication to queues, cache, and cron-jobs, from realtime
capabilities to the low-code endpoint designer, each component of Agnost is a
unique color on your palette. Mix and match, combine and contrast, the artwork
you create is entirely up to you.

Do you need to build a state-of-the-art web application? Agnost is at your
service. Or maybe a CRM application that can handle vast amounts of data? Agnost
