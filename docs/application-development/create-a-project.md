# New Agnost Project

Creating a new project in Agnost involves defining your organization,
application, resources, and versions. Each project is fully customizable to fit
your unique needs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can create a new
Agnost project:

1. **Create a New Application:** Inside your organization, click on the 'New
   Application' button. You'll need to enter the application name, description,
   and select the type of application. Click 'Create' when you're done.

2. **Create a Version:** For each application, you can create multiple versions.
   These versions work similar to branches in git, allowing you to work on
   different features or bug fixes independently. To create a new version, click
   on the 'Add Version' button, provide the necessary details, and click
   'Create'.

3. **Define Resources:** Each application in Agnost can have multiple resources.
   These resources include databases, caches, message queues, etc. To add a
   resource, click on the 'Add Resource' button and choose the type of resource
   you want to add. You'll need to provide necessary details for the resource.
   If it's a database, for instance, you might need to provide details like the
   database type (MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL, etc.), host, port, username, password,
   etc. You also have the option to connect to an existing resource or create a
   new one.

4. **Develop Your Application:** Once you've set up your organization,
   application, resources, and versions, you can start developing your
   application. Agnost provides a visual interface for designing your
   application, where you can define data models, create endpoints, schedule
   cron jobs, and more.

Creating a new project in Agnost sets the foundation for your application
development. Once the project is set up, you can iteratively develop, test, and
deploy your application, ensuring a seamless software development lifecycle.
