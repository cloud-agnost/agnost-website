# Implementing Backend APIs

Implementing backend APIs is a critical part of any application development
process. In Agnost, the task is made simpler with the visual interface, and it
allows for code-based modifications as well. Here are the steps you can follow
to implement backend APIs in your Agnost project:

1. **Access Application Version:** Navigate to your application in the Agnost
   Studio and select the version where you want to implement the backend API.

2. **Create a New Endpoint:** Click on the 'New Endpoint' button. You'll need to
   enter the endpoint name, path, and select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT,
   DELETE, etc.).

3. **Define Request Parameters:** If your endpoint requires any request
   parameters, you can add them by clicking the 'Add Parameter' button. For each
   parameter, you need to specify the name, type, and whether it is required.

4. **Define Response Schema:** Next, define the response schema for your
   endpoint. This is what the API will return when it is called. Agnost supports
   a variety of data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and
   objects.

5. **Write the Handler Code:** This is where you provide the logic for your
   endpoint. The handler code is written in JavaScript. It takes a request
   object as an argument, processes the request based on the logic you define,
   and returns a response. The request object contains the request parameters,
   body, headers, etc. You can use various libraries and services provided by
   Agnost in your handler code, such as database operations, caching, queuing,
   etc.

6. **Test the API Endpoint:** Once you have written your handler code, you can
   test your API endpoint directly from Agnost Studio. Click on the 'Test'
   button and provide any necessary input data. You will see the API response
   displayed in the response window.

7. **Deploy the API Endpoint:** After you have tested and are satisfied with
   your API endpoint, you can deploy it by clicking on the 'Deploy' button. The
   API endpoint will then be available for use by the frontend of your
   application or by other services that might need to consume it.

Agnost ensures a seamless experience in implementing backend APIs by providing a
visual interface for defining the request and response schemas, writing handler
code, testing, and deploying the API. This way, you can focus more on developing
your application logic, while Agnost takes care of the rest.
