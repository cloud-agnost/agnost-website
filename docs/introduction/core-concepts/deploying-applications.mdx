# Deploying Applications

Agnost, being a cloud provider agnostic platform, offers the ability to deploy
your applications on multiple cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and even your own
on-premise Kubernetes clusters.

Below is a brief guide on how you can deploy your applications to these
platforms:

### Deploying Your Application

With Agnost, deploying your application is a straightforward process:

1. **Navigate to your Application:** In Agnost-Studio, navigate to the
   application you want to deploy.

2. **Select the Version:** Select the version of the application that you wish
   to deploy.

3. **Click Deploy:** Click on the 'Deploy' button. This will start the
   deployment process. The Agnost Engine-Worker module will handle the
   deployment of the application design to the databases, API servers, and cron
   job scheduler.

### Deploying to Different Platforms

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Deploy your applications to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):

1. **Create an EKS Cluster:** You need to first create an EKS cluster on AWS.
   Make sure that the cluster configuration aligns with the system requirements
   of your application.

2. **Connect your EKS Cluster to Agnost:** In the Agnost platform, provide the
   necessary details (like the API server endpoint, Cluster name, Secret, etc.)
   to establish a connection to the EKS cluster.

3. **Deploy your Application:** Follow the standard Agnost deployment process to
   deploy your application to the connected EKS cluster.

#### Microsoft Azure (AKS)

Deploy your applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

1. **Create an AKS Cluster:** Similar to AWS, you first need to create an AKS
   cluster on Azure. Configure the cluster according to the needs of your
   application.

2. **Connect your AKS Cluster to Agnost:** Provide the details required (like
   the API server endpoint, Cluster name, Secret, etc.) in the Agnost platform
   to connect to the AKS cluster.

3. **Deploy your Application:** Once the AKS cluster is connected, you can
   deploy your application to it using Agnost's deployment process.

#### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Deploy your applications to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

1. **Create a GKE Cluster:** Begin by creating a GKE cluster on GCP. Ensure the
   configuration suits your application's system requirements.

2. **Connect your GKE Cluster to Agnost:** In the Agnost platform, fill in the
   necessary details (like the API server endpoint, Cluster name, Secret, etc.)
   to create a connection to the GKE cluster.

3. **Deploy your Application:** After the GKE cluster is connected, you can
   deploy your application to it using the Agnost deployment process.

#### On-Premise Deployment

Deploy your applications to your own Kubernetes clusters:

1. **Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up a Kubernetes cluster based on your
   application's system requirements. This could be on your own servers or a
   private cloud.

2. **Connect your Cluster to Agnost:** Provide the details required (like the
   API server endpoint, Cluster name, Secret, etc.) in the Agnost platform to
   establish a connection to your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Deploy your Application:** Once the Kubernetes cluster is connected, you
   can deploy your application to it using the Agnost deployment process.

Through Agnost's flexible deployment options, you have the freedom to choose
where and how you want to run your applications. It not only ensures the
portability of your applications across various platforms but also provides you
with a consistent and streamlined deployment process.

### Pre-deployment Checks

Before deploying your application, ensure that:

- Your application is correctly configured and all required resources
  (databases, message queues, caches, etc.) are either set up within the Agnost
  platform or connected as external resources.

- You have correctly defined and tested all your application endpoints.

- All the environment variables your application requires are defined.

### Post-deployment Checks

After your application is deployed, it's a good practice to ensure that:

- All application endpoints are working as expected. You can use tools like
  Postman or curl to test your endpoints.

- Your application is correctly interacting with all the resources (databases,
  message queues, caches, etc.).

- The application logs are correctly being recorded in the Platform-Database.
  You can view these logs through Agnost-Studio.

### Scaling Your Application

Agnost uses Knative to automatically scale your applications based on load. This
allows your application to handle high traffic volumes effectively and utilize
resources efficiently. When traffic decreases, your application will scale down,
thus saving resources.

It's important to note that while Knative can scale your application down to
zero pods during periods of inactivity, you can also set a minimum number of
pods to remain running at all times if you expect sudden traffic spikes.

Remember, managing and maintaining your application post-deployment is just as
crucial as the initial setup and deployment. Agnost provides the necessary tools
for monitoring, debugging, and versioning, which will assist in the smooth
running of your application.
