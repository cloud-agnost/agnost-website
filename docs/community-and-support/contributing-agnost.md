# Contributing to Agnost

Agnost is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the
community. There are many ways you can contribute, whether you're a developer, a
designer, a writer, or a user. Here are some ways you can contribute to the
Agnost project.

### Contribute Code

If you're a developer and want to contribute code to the project, you can start
by checking the open issues in the
[Agnost GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloud-agnost). If you want to work
on a specific issue, please comment on the issue to let others know you're
working on it.

Before you start coding, please review the

### Improve Documentation

Good documentation is as important as good code. If you enjoy writing or have a
knack for explaining complex concepts in a simple way, you can help improve the
Agnost documentation. This can involve writing new guides or tutorials,
improving existing documentation, or fixing typos and grammatical errors.

### Report Bugs or Request Features
