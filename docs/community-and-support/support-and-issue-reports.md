# Getting Support and Reporting Issues

There are several ways you can get support or report issues when you encounter
problems with Agnost. It's important to provide as much detail as possible when
reporting issues so that the community and Agnost team can understand and
reproduce your problem in order to help you.

### Reporting Issues on GitHub

If you encounter a bug or issue, please open an issue on the
[Agnost GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloud-agnost). Provide as much
detail as possible, including:

- Agnost version
- Deployment environment (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, On-Premise Kubernetes)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs if possible

The Agnost team monitors the GitHub issues regularly and will respond as soon as
possible.

### Asking Questions on the Forum

If you have questions about how to use Agnost or best practices, the
[Agnost Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-agnost/discussions) is a
great place to ask. Be sure to search the forum first in case someone else has
already asked the same question.

### Email Support

For more critical or specific issues related to your use case, you can email the
Agnost support team directly at support@agnost.dev. Be sure to provide detailed
information about your issue and your environment to help the support team
understand and resolve your issue as quickly as possible.

Remember, the more specific and detailed your question or problem description
is, the faster and more accurately someone can help you.
