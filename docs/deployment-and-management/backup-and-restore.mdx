# Backing Up and Restoring Data

Backing up your data regularly and ensuring that you can restore it if required
should be a part of your application's maintenance routine. Agnost provides
built-in tools that help you back up and restore your data with ease.

### Backing Up Data

Agnost's built-in backup feature allows you to create backups of your
application data at regular intervals. This feature can be configured in the
Agnost Studio under the "Backup" section of your application's settings.

Here's how to set up automatic backups:

1. Navigate to your application's settings in Agnost Studio.
2. Click on the "Backup" section.
3. Specify the backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) and the
   retention period for the backups.
4. Choose the destination for the backup data. Agnost supports multiple storage
   options, including cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage,
   and Azure Blob Storage, and local storage within the Kubernetes cluster.

Once configured, Agnost will automatically create backups of your application
data at the specified intervals and store them at the specified destination.

### Restoring Data

In case of data loss or corruption, you can restore your data from a backup. The
process of restoring data involves:

1. Navigate to the "Backup" section in the Agnost Studio.
2. Choose the backup from which you want to restore data. You will see a list of
   all the backups available for your application, along with their creation
   dates.
3. Click on the "Restore" button next to the backup you want to use for
   restoration.

Agnost will then restore your application's data from the chosen backup. The
duration of the restoration process will depend on the size of your data and the
speed of the storage service.

By using Agnost's backup and restore functionality, you can ensure the safety
and integrity of your application's data. It provides you with peace of mind,
knowing that your data is safe and can be restored if something goes wrong.
