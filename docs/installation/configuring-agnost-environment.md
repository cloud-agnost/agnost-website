# Configuring Agnost Environment

Setting up your Agnost environment involves configuring the resources for your
applications. This section walks you through the essential steps to correctly
configure your Agnost environment for application development.

### Step 1: Access the Agnost Studio

Start by accessing the Agnost studio. This web-based interface allows you to
manage all aspects of your Agnost environment, including your organizations,
applications, and resources.

### Step 2: Create or Select Your Organization

In the Agnost Studio, you can create a new organization or select an existing
one. An organization groups together related applications, making it easier to
manage applications.

### Step 3: Create or Select Your Application

Within your organization, create a new application or select an existing one.
Each application is a separate entity within Agnost, with its own set of
resources.

### Step 4: Configure Your Resources

Within your application, you will configure resources. Resources are the various
components your application needs to function, including databases, cache
systems, message queues, and more.

You can create new resources or connect to existing ones.

- **To connect an existing resource**, select the 'Connect existing resource'
  option, and then input the necessary connection details for the resource.

- **To create a new resource**, select the 'Create new resource' option, choose
  the type of resource you want to create (for instance, MySQL, Oracle, or MSSQL
  for databases, or RabbitMQ or Kafka for message queues), and then fill out the
  resource's details in the guided setup process.

### Step 5: Save Your Configuration

After setting up your resources, save your configuration. Agnost will store your
configuration details, allowing you to quickly set up similar environments in
the future.

You've now configured your Agnost environment! You're ready to start developing
applications. Remember that you can always return to the Agnost Studio to make
changes to your environment as your application's requirements change.

In the following sections, we'll explore more advanced Agnost features,
including monitoring tools, scaling options, and more. Stay tuned!
